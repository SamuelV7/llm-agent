Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel! Today I’m going to walk you through a very cool platform I’ve been using lately—Milanote. 
Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects, and it has quickly become a huge part of my process. 
Whether I’m working on a personal project or collaborating with a team, Milanote helps me visualize everything in one place and stay on track.

First off, let me stress how accessible this platform is to get started with: you can sign up for free with no time-limit, 
which is amazing because it means you have plenty of freedom to try out different boards, templates, and layouts without feeling rushed or constrained 
by a trial period. If you’ve been on the fence about trying new organizational tools, this might be exactly the push you need. 
Speaking of which, I’ll drop a link in the description where you can sign up—definitely check it out after this video.

Now, let’s talk about how I’m currently using Milanote. I have several boards set up, but I’m going to highlight two of them in particular. 
First is my **Vision Board**, where I gather images, color palettes, and general style references that inspire my new design project. 
This board is super visual—think of it like a mood board on steroids. I can drag and drop images directly from the web, 
rearrange them into neat clusters, and jot down quick notes about why each image caught my eye. I also add color swatches 
whenever I find a combination I love. Being able to see it all at once helps me maintain a consistent theme across my work.

The second board I want to show you is my **Project Plan** board, which I’ve organized into different sections for planning, 
task management, and scheduling. I’ve pinned research materials, scripts, contact details, and even to-do lists. 
I also color-code tasks to indicate whether something is in progress, blocked, or completed. That way, I can see my entire project 
status at a glance. And yes, I realize a lot of apps do something similar, but the biggest difference with Milanote is the 
freedom to lay everything out visually in whatever way makes sense to you. Nothing is locked into a rigid format, and you can create 
boards within boards if you really want to keep subprojects organized.

One of my favorite features, though, has to be the ability to share boards with others. I just send them a link, and they can hop into the 
same workspace, leave comments, and move elements around in real time. This has been a lifesaver for me when I need to gather feedback. It feels more 
like pinning notes up on a real whiteboard and letting everyone scribble down their ideas. Gone are the days of endless email threads or 
searching for the latest version of a doc. If you’re collaborating with a client or team, real-time editing and commenting can 
streamline the entire revision process.

Now, let’s move on to something else that’s pretty cool: planning out your YouTube thumbnails. Having a strong thumbnail strategy is 
critical for capturing viewer attention, and I love using Milanote for that. I set up an entire thumbnail board with sections dedicated to 
color schemes, text overlays, and potential expressions or poses. It’s super easy to see how different thumbnail concepts look side by side, 
and you can quickly shuffle them around or compare variations before finalizing one. Plus, I can invite my videographer or graphic designer into the 
board, and they can drop in new ideas. I’ve even used the comment feature to have short discussions about font choices. It’s a huge time-saver and keeps 
everything in one spot.

Anyway, that’s just a quick look at how I’m using Milanote. There’s a ton more you can do—like building storyboards, mind maps, character relationship diagrams, 
or even a full writing plan. If you’re a creative looking for a more fluid and visual way to organize your projects, you’ll probably love it as 
much as I do. Remember: you can sign up for free with no time-limit, so feel free to experiment at your own pace.

As always, thanks for watching. If you found this helpful, give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing. And definitely check out the Milanote link 
in the description to give it a try. I’m sure it’ll help you stay on top of your creative projects, whether you’re a designer, filmmaker, 
writer, or just someone like me who needs all the visual inspiration possible. Let me know in the comments what kind of boards you end up 
making—I’d love to see how you’re using Milanote in your own workflow. Take care, and I’ll see you in the next one!
